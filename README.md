## Features

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  Organizes your application into distinct modules (routes, models, services, configurations) to maintain clean, reusable code.

- **Production-Ready Configuration:**  
  Preconfigured settings for logging, error handling, and environment management, simplifying scaling and troubleshooting.

- **Containerization and Deployment:**  
  Integrated Docker support (with docker-compose) ensures consistent operation across various environments, easing deployment to cloud services or on-premise servers.

- **Asynchronous Capabilities:**  
  Leverages FastAPI's asynchronous programming model to build high-performance APIs capable of handling multiple concurrent requests.

- **Testing and CI/CD Integration:**  
  Includes sample tests and CI/CD configurations to help ensure reliability and foster a culture of robust, maintainable code.

- **Scalability and Maintainability:**  
  Designed to grow with your project—ideal for both small microservices and large-scale applications while reducing technical debt.

A typical project structure might look like this:

├── app │ ├── api │ │ ├── endpoints │ │ └── dependencies │ ├── core │ │ ├── config.py │ │ └── logging.py │ ├── models │ ├── services │ └── main.py ├── tests │ ├── test_main.py │ └── ... ├── Dockerfile ├── docker-compose.yml ├── requirements.txt └── README.md


## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fsh10/FastAPI_production_template.git
   cd FastAPI_production_template
Create a Virtual Environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Customize your project settings in the configuration file (app/core/config.py). Adjust parameters for logging, error handling, and environment variables as needed for your specific deployment environment.

Usage
Run the application using Uvicorn:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Then, navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access your FastAPI application.

Testing and CI/CD
Ensure your application remains reliable with the included sample tests:

pytest
Integrate these tests into your CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.

Deployment
Using Docker
Build the Docker image:

docker build -t fastapi_app .
Run the container:

docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi_app
Using Docker Compose
Alternatively, deploy with Docker Compose:

docker-compose up --build
